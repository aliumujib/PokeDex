# Pokedex App
Pokedex app for finding information about your favorite pokemon! still could use a bit more detail, but the point of the whole app was to learn how to use AlamoFire and APIs in swift which I think I now know ... So enough of that.

## Pokedex

<img src="Screens/SCREEN2.jpeg" width="250" />
<img src="Screens/SCREEN3.jpeg" width="250" />

Learnt a lot about using NSLayoutConstriaints to arrange my views ... honestly prefer CGRect tho .. but then it is all good!

## Technology Stack
** NSLayoutConstriaints
** Alamofire
** Collection Views
** Auto layout
** ComplimentaryGradientView

## TODO

** Add more detail data to the detail view of the pokemon them and what not but meh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
